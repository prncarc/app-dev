# Favorite Food
My favorite food is Humba.

Pork Humba with pineapple, tausi, and dried banana blossoms is a delicious medley of sweet and savory flavors you'll love with steamed rice! This Visayan version of adobo is easy to make and sure to be a family favorite.

Let’s prepare the ingredients for your humba! Dice one large onion and mince 5 cloves of garlic. You will also need these other following ingredients:

Pork belly.

Pineapple juice.

Salted black beans.

Soy sauce.

Vinegar.

Banana blossoms.

Dried bay leaves.

Peppercorn.

Brown sugar (alternatively, you can use palm sugar –– just not white! Brown sugar has a less emphatic sweetness, and also operates as a natural thickener for your sauce).
